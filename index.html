        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India's street dog population is closely associated with municipal sanitation practices ‚Äì or neglect thereof. Because these homeless dogs often survive by scavenging rubbish, exposed garbage means more healthy dogs ‚Äì and more puppies. Ironically, this actually makes the dogs a boon to public sanitation. By scavenging garbage, they reduce perishable waste that could otherwise be a source of contamination for people. And their presence around garbage keeps away other potentially dangerous scavengers, such as rats and mice. Unfortunately, fear and ignorance have led many Indian citizens and officials to see street dogs as nothing but a nuisance and to seek eradication using inhumane methods such as poisoning and beating. But for every dog killed, another typically comes in to take over that dog's territory. The only scientific method to humanely reduce street dog populations is mass spay and neuters, commonly known as animal birth control (ABC).</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Buying a puppy from the pet store might be one of the most phenomenal moments in life. Unfortunately, puppy mills sell their malnourished dogs to pet stores. Puppy mills are huge kennels where purebred puppies are crowded together in unsanitary housing with no food. Dogs who did no wrong to this world do not deserve to live in these conditions. The number of puppy mills is increasing and must be stopped by adopting dogs from shelters, not buying puppies from pet stores, and putting stronger laws into action.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">If you can't afford to pet them just give them a portion of food so they can save from starving and saved from eating waste due to hungriness.This means, dogs should not be fed on public footpaths and roads, at the entrance of homes and apartment complexes, or at playgrounds frequented by children. Instead, places such as the near the boundary walls, vacant plots, and service lanes, could be used by dog lovers to feed strays.</p>
